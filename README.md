# Shopping Log

This is a simple, local project I created to log the products I buy, organized by date. It's like a basic to-do list but for shopping!

## Features:
- Add products with details like price and purchase date.
- Keeps track of all the things you buy on a specific day.
- View the total cost of all items you've purchased so far.
- Edit or remove any entry if needed.
- **Local Storage**: The app now saves your shopping entries in local storage, so your data persists even after you close the app.

## Why I Made It:
I made this project because I couldn't find a shopping log app that had exactly what I wanted. So, I decided to build it myself, even though it's pretty basic right now!
