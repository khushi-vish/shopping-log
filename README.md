# Shopping Log

This is a simple, local project I created to log the products I buy, organized by date. It's like a basic to-do list but for shopping!

### Features:
- Add products with details like price and purchase date.
- Keeps track of all the things you buy on a specific day.
- View the total cost of all items you've purchased so far.
- Edit or remove any entry if needed.

### Whatâ€™s Missing:
- **Data Saving:** Right now, the data doesn't get saved after you close the app. I'll try to add a way to save your entries in the future.

### Why I Made It:
I made this project because I couldn't find a shopping log app that had exactly what I wanted. So, I decided to build it myself, even though it's pretty basic right now!
